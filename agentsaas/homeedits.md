Every Missed Call Is a Lost Patient

Here’s what happens in most dental practices:

Front desk is busy

Phone rings

Voicemail picks up

Patient hangs up

They call another dentist


You never see the loss — but it adds up fast.

📉 Average practice misses 10–15 calls/week
💸 That’s $50,000+ per year in lost treatment


---

DentalAnswer AI Fixes This Automatically

DentalAnswer AI answers every call in under 3 seconds and books appointments in real time.

No call forwarding.
No messages.
No “please call back later.”

On every call, it:

✔ Sounds human — not robotic
✔ Collects patient info & insurance
✔ Checks live calendar availability
✔ Books the appointment
✔ Sends SMS & email confirmation
✔ Transfers complex calls to staff

All without interrupting your team.


---

The ROI Is Immediate

Let’s keep it simple:

One booked appointment ≈ $500

DentalAnswer AI costs $497/month


If it books just one patient, it pays for itself.

Most practices book 10–30 extra patients per month.


---

“But I Don’t Trust AI With My Phones”

Neither did our early customers — until they heard the calls.

DentalAnswer AI is designed for safety:

Handles routine bookings only

Knows when to transfer to humans

Follows your office hours & rules

HIPAA-compliant infrastructure


Think of it as:
